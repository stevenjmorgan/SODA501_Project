We utilize Stanford NER, a Java implementation of a Named Entity Recognizer. Per the Stanford NLP Group website: "Named Entity Recognition (NER) labels sequences of words in a text which are the names of things, such as person and company names, or gene and protein names. It comes with well-engineered feature extractors for Named Entity Recognition, and many options for defining feature extractors." For more information regarding this implementation, please visit https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html.

These scripts take .txt files as input, extract named entities, and then output to .JSON files. These .JSON's are then utilized for network analysis.
